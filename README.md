<h1>"ScabSVM: Implementing Support Vector Machine Algorithm for Scabies Disease Prediction in Patients (Case Study: Sidowaras Clinic)"</h1>

## Introduction
“Support Vector Algorithm Implementation Machine for Predicting Scabies in Patients”. Expected with the application of the Support Vector Machine algorithm to predict scabies can minimize errors in making a diagnosis, especially can differentiate between scabies and non-scabies skin disease.
